#This is a shell
This is a shell I'm making for basically no reason. It works just like 
bash, but lacks some of the features.

#Features
- Navigate file system with 'cd' command
- Run external programs both locally and from PATH variable
- Pipe output from one program to the input of another
- Redirect command output to files (overwriting or appending)
- Read basic scripts consisting of commands to execute in order

#Built in commands/Syntax
- 'cd' - change directory
- 'exit' - exit shell
- 'command1 | command2' - pipe output from command1 to input of command2
- '(series of commands) > file' - write output to file
- '(series of commands) >> file' - append output to file
